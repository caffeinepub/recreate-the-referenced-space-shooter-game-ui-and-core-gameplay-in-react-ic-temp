  "summary": "The diff implements the requested touch-control layout/styling changes (shoot label to “SHOOT”, neon styling tokens, and described swapped control positions), but also includes several additional UI/theme/debug and utility changes not requested by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added debug/force flags via URL parameters (e.g., debugControls, forceTouchControls) and related logic.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is limited to touch control layout/styling; it does not request new debug modes or URL-parameter overrides.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/screens/GameScreen.tsx",
        "frontend/src/utils/urlParams.ts"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Expanded URL parameter utilities and sessionStorage persistence helpers (storeSessionParameter/getPersistedUrlParameter/etc.).",
      "reason": "Not part of requested control layout/styling updates.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/utils/urlParams.ts"

    },
    {
      "description": "Broader UI redesign beyond touch controls (menu redesign, HUD refresh, theme system/glass-card effects, neon design tokens).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest scope is touch controls overlay layout/styling only; menu/HUD redesign is outside stated non-goals (“no new gameplay mechanics… beyond presentation/layout changes” applies to controls, not whole UI).",

    },
    {
      "description": "Canvas renderer changes (devicePixelRatio-aware sizing, neon border, pointer-events disabled on canvas).",
      "reason": "Not requested; touch control styling/layout can be done without altering the renderer/canvas behavior.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Touch shooting behavior augmented with additional resets on visibility/orientation change.",
      "reason": "REQ-1/REQ-2 specify no behavior changes beyond presentation; adding new reset triggers is a behavioral change (even if beneficial).",
