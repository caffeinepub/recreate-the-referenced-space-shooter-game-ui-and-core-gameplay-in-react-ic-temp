  "summary": "Joystick and Shoot button UIs appear to be converted from image-based to code-rendered neon/glow designs with touch/mouse handling preserved. Player ship rendering in the canvas appears replaced with Canvas 2D vector drawing (no image usage visible). However, the diff also introduces additional, non-requested rendering/viewport behavior changes (e.g., visualViewport resizing and a visible canvas border) and broad styling/theme utility additions that were not explicitly requested.",

    {
      "description": "Changed canvas sizing logic to use window.visualViewport (and added listeners) beyond just replacing the player ship image rendering.",
      "reason": "REQ-28 only asks to replace the ship image with code-rendered drawing while preserving rotation and performance; viewport sizing changes are not requested.",

      "description": "Added drawing of a visible neon border rectangle around the entire canvas.",
      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-28/29; request scope was limited to joystick, shoot button, and player ship visuals, and explicitly said not to redesign other visuals/layout.",

    {
      "description": "Modified bullet rendering to include size-based color variations (small/medium/large) with glow settings shown in the render loop.",
      "reason": "Not requested; non-goals include not changing bullets. Even if only visual, it extends beyond the requested three elements (joystick/shoot/ship).",
