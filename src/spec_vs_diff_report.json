  "summary": "The diff appears to implement all three requested visual updates: spark VFX on bullet–obstacle hits (with lifetime/cleanup fields), per-obstacle consistent neon colors, and fixed-size flame-shaped bullets oriented to travel direction. The diff also includes additional unrelated rendering/canvas behavior changes that were not requested.",

      "description": "Canvas resizing behavior updated to use `window.visualViewport` and additional resize/orientation listeners for mobile support.",
      "reason": "Not requested by REQ-37/38/39; this is an extra behavior change unrelated to sparks, obstacle colors, or bullet shape/size.",

      "description": "New/expanded bullet typing supports multiple shapes (`circle|diamond|capsule|flame`) and still retains bullet size categories in types/config despite the request focusing only on consistent flame visuals.",
      "reason": "REQ-39 only requires consistent-size flame-shaped rendering; introducing additional shape variants/types was not requested (even if not exposed).",
